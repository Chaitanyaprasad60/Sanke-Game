# Sanke-Game
This a Snake Game Inspired by Nokia games. I've used Python-pygame to make this game.

I control the head of the snake to move using pygame events. <br>
Then I copy the location of head to the next part of snake and so on the snake seems to move in real.<br> 
I using a random coordinate geneartor to place the fruit(food) for the snake due to which the snakes lenth increases.
