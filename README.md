# Sanke-Game
This a Snake Game Inspired by Nokia games. I've used Python-pygame to make this game.

I control the head of the snake to move using pygame events. <br>
Then I copy the location of the head to the next part of the snake and so on the snake seems to move in real.<br> 
I use a random coordinate generator to place the fruit(food) for the snake due to which the snake's length increases. 

# To Run in Local 
pip3 install pygame #To Install Dependencies <br>
py snakegame.py
